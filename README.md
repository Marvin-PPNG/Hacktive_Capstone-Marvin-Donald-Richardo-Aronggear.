# Sentiment Analysis of YouTube comments related to the video “The REAL Cure for Cancer” using SVM and Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
  This project aims to analyze public sentiment toward the YouTube video titled “The REAL Cure for Cancer.” Using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, comments from the video are classified into three main categories: positive, neutral, and negative. The goal of this analysis is to gain insight into public responses and identify dominant themes or emotions expressed in online discussions surrounding the topic of cancer.

## Insight and Findings
  The sentiment analysis compared two machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression—to classify YouTube comments related to the video "The REAL Cure for Cancer." Overall, the results show that SVM outperforms Logistic Regression across most evaluation metrics, including accuracy (0.7729 vs. 0.7488), recall (0.7729 vs. 0.7488), and F1-score (0.7709 vs. 0.7325), while precision remains nearly equal between the two. These results suggest that SVM is more reliable and consistent in handling the multi-class sentiment classification task, particularly in dealing with class imbalance.
  Further analysis of performance by sentiment class reveals that Logistic Regression tends to overfit the negative class, with extremely high recall (0.99) but relatively low precision (0.69), indicating many false positives. Conversely, it struggles to detect positive sentiment accurately, with a low recall of only 0.42 despite having high precision (0.86). On the other hand, SVM provides a more balanced performance, with significantly improved recall for the positive class (0.79) and better F1-scores across all classes. Neutral sentiment remains the most challenging for both models, which is common in sentiment analysis due to its often ambiguous or context-dependent nature.
  The bar chart visualization supports these conclusions, showing SVM’s consistent performance across metrics, while Logistic Regression falls short in terms of overall balance. These findings suggest that SVM is better suited for text classification tasks involving short, informal text such as YouTube comments, especially when sentiment categories are not evenly distributed.



## A.I Support Explanation
  This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, to transform thousands of YouTube comments into meaningful insights. NLP techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming were applied to clean and standardize the raw textual data, preparing it for further analysis. To assess the emotional polarity of each comment, VADER sentiment analysis was employed as an initial step, using a lexicon-based approach. The processed text was then converted into numerical representations using TF-IDF vectorization, allowing the machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression to classify the comments into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments automatically. The performance of these models was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a quantitative assessment of AI effectiveness.

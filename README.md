##Project Overview
This project aims to analyze public sentiment toward the YouTube video titled “The REAL Cure for Cancer.” Using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, comments from the video are classified into three main categories: positive, neutral, and negative. The goal of this analysis is to gain insight into public responses and identify dominant themes or emotions expressed in online discussions surrounding the topic of cancer.
